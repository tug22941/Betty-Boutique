# Betty-Boutique
The Betty Boutique repository houses a boutique store web application. This application allows two user types: Users and Admin. Both user type functionalities include browsing the storeâ€™s clothing selections, adding items to the shopping cart, checking out the shopping cart, and viewing user information and past history. Only Admin users have the functionality to create new users and products, as well as edit existing users and products.

This app is intended as a capstone project for PNC TEKsystems 2023 Java Full-Stack Development training course (2023-RTT-45-JAVA).
